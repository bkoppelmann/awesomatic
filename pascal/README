A specification for an analyzer for Pascal.
The contents of this directory are:

Structure.fw	Specification of abstract syntax tree construction
Name.fw		Specification of name analysis
Type.fw		Specification of type
Context.fw	Specification of context condition verification

wrapper.tex	Files needed for creating a printed specification
title.tex

Odinfile	Commands that build some useful products

To use the analyzer specified in this directory as a component of a
complete compiler, put the following line into the .specs file for that
compiler:

Pascal%Pascal.specs

This assumes that the directory containing this README is named "Pascal"
and is a subdirectory of the directory in which the .specs file resides.
If that is not the case, replace "Pascal" in the line with an appropriate
path.

You can request any of the following products by invoking "eli" with the
name of the product as its argument (e.g. "eli pascal"):

pascal		Executable version of the complete analyzer

Pascal.pdf	PDF version of the complete specification

File wrapper.tex contains directives for setting layout parameters for
either US Letter or A4 format.  Before generating a formatted version of
the document, verify that wrapper.tex specifies the appropriate paper.
