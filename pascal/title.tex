\title{An Analyzer for Pascal}
\author{W. M. Waite}
\maketitle

This document describes an analyzer for Pascal (ANSI/IEEE 770X3.97-1983).
It was generated from an
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{Eli}{http://eli-project.sourceforge.net}
specification of that analyzer.

An abstract syntax tree structure describing the essential semantics
of Pascal is given in Section \ref{sec:structure},
along with the Eli specifications necessary to build the AST corresponding
to any legal program.

The computations specified in Sections \ref{sec:name} and \ref{sec:type}
decorate the nodes of the tree with information about
the binding of identifiers and the type of expressions, respectively.
Section \ref{sec:context} uses these decorations to report semantic errors.

Eli can generate an executable analyzer for Pascal from the
specifications used to derive this document.
If these specifications are combined with Eli specifications for
translation and encoding tasks, Eli can generate a complete compiler for
Pascal.

The translation specification will need to deal with the following
important issues:

\begin{itemize}
\item Overlaid storage
\item Insertion of type conversion operators
\end{itemize}
