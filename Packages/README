These instructions are guidelines for package developers wishing to
release a new version of package "PKG".  They assume that all of the
desired changes have been checked in, and that you are in the "Packages
working directory.  Note that the tag "PKG_1_2_3" and name "PKG-1.2.3"
should be changed to reflect the particular package and the version
being released.

1. Update the version number and tag the repository:

	cd PKGDist
        <edit PKG/version to bump the number>
        cvs ci PKG/version
	cvs tag PKG_1_2_3
	cd ..

2. Export a copy of the package and create the tar file:

	cvs export -r PKG_1_1_3 -d PKG-1.2.3 Packages/PKGDist
	tar -jcf PKG-1.2.3.tar.bz2 PKG-1.2.3

3. Follow the current directions for installing PKG-1.2.3.tar.bz2
   on SourceForge:  Log onto SourceForge and go to the bottom of the
   screen.  Under "Help", click on the "Site Documentation" link.
   The relevant document is "Release Files for Download", under
   "Hosting with SourceForge.net" in the second bullet ("Downloads
   and metrics").  Create the package "PKG" if necessary; this is
   where you want to upload the tar file of the distribution.

4. Remove the file and directory created during this process:

	rm -rf PKG-1.2.3*

If the update contains significant new functionality, send an announcement
to compilers@iecc.com.  Your e-mail should be pure ASCII, not HTML.  For
further information, see http://compilers.iecc.com/faq.txt.
