bisonglr implements the Bison GLR parser generator.  It can be used
to create processors for some languages whose concrete grammars are
not LALR(1).  File bisonglr/nonlr.fw illustrates such a grammar.
After building a cache with the bisonglr package, you can test it by
generating an analyzer from file bisonglr/nonlr.fw:

  -> nonlr.fw :exe
  -> nonlr.fw +parser=bisonglr :exe

The first request will fail with the report "Grammar is not LALR(1)",
because it uses the default parser generator.  The second request,
which invokes the Bison GLR parser generator, will succeed.
