Eli specification implementing the "Revised Report on the Algorithmic
Language ALGOL 69" (Communications of the Association for Computing
Machinery, 6 (January, 1963) 1-17).  This example shows how an executable
specification can be written to parallel a language standard, enhancing the
verifiability of the resulting compiler.

The contents of this directory are:

ALGOL60.fw		The ALGOL 60 specification

HtmlALGOL60.fw	Wrapper for the specification in HTML
TexALGOL60.fw	Wrapper for the specification in PostScript
abstract.fwi	Abstract for the printed specification

tests		A collection of ALGOL 60 test programs

Odinfile	Commands that build some useful products

You can request any of the following products by invoking "eli" with the
name of the product as its argument (e.g. "eli a60"):

a60		Executable processor for ALGOL 60

%source		All files, including a Makefile, needed to implement the
		ALGOL 60 processor independent of Eli.  This product should
		be redirected to a directory (e.g. "eli '%source>src'").

a60.html	Formatted specification with hyperlinks
a60.pdf		Formatted specification for printing

%lint		Build a ALGOL 60 processor and test it by applying it to all
		of the ALGOL 60 programs in the test suite.  The executable
		version of the processor will be left as file "a60" in
		this directory.

		These tests will all produce nothing if they are successful.
		If the generated processor detects errors when attempting to
		compile any conforming program, or fails to detect errors in
		any deviating program, the test will stop at that point.
		The test program for which the errors were reported will be
		copied to file "input" in this directory, and the error
		reports will be written to file "ERR" in this directory.
