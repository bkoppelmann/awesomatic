This document was generated by the Eli system (http://www.cs.colorado.edu)
from an operational description of the host support for Java packages,
compilation units and subpackages.
Eli can also generate the executable module
needed by a Java compiler from the description.
By following Section 7.2.1 of the Java definition as closely as possible,
this operational description provides traceability for processor features:
It is easy to verify that the processor actually implements the required
support, and to discover errors and omissions.
