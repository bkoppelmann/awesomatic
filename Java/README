Eli specifications for Java.  The contents of this directory are:

Java.fw			The Java specification

HtmlJava.fw		Wrapper for the specification in HTML
TexJava.fw		Wrapper for the specification in PostScript
abstract.fw		Abstract for the printed specification

CheckNames.specs	Processor printing the result of name analysis
CheckNames.fw		Computations that print names

tests			A collection of Java test programs

Odinfile		Commands that build some useful products

You can request any of the following products by invoking "eli" with the
name of the product as its argument (e.g. "eli javac"):

javac		Executable processor for Java

%source		All files, including a Makefile, needed to implement the
		Java processor independent of Eli.  This product should
		be redirected to a directory (e.g. "eli '%source>src'").

java.html	Formatted specification with hyperlinks
java.ps		Formatted specification for printing

%lint		Build a Java processor and test it by applying it to all
		of the Java programs in the test suite.  The executable
		version of the processor will be left as file "javac" in
		this directory.

		These tests will all produce nothing if they are successful.
		If the generated processor detects errors when attempting to
		compile any conforming program, or fails to detect errors in
		any deviating program, the test will stop at that point.
		The test program for which the errors were reported will be
		copied to file "input" in this directory, and the error
		reports will be written to file "ERR" in this directory.

%names		Build a Java processor containing additional code to print
		information about the binding of simple names.  Java text
		will be read from file "input" in this directory, and the
		result will be presented as an info browser session.  No
		executable version of the test processor will be placed in
		this directory.
