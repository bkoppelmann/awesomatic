This document was generated by the Eli system (http://www.cs.colorado.edu)
from an operational description of the analysis of Java class files.
Eli can also generate an executable abstract data type to input information
needed by a Java compiler from the description.
By following the structure of the Java class file format specification as
closely as possible, this operational description provides traceability for
processor features:
It is easy to verify that the processor actually implements the class file
format, and to discover errors and omissions.
