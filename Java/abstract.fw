This document was generated by the Eli system (http://www.cs.colorado.edu)
from a set of files describing subproblems of Java compilation.
Eli can also generate an executable processor solving those subproblems
from the same set of files.
By following the structure of the draft definition of Java as closely as
possible, the description provides traceability for processor features:
It is easy to verify that the processor actually implements the draft
definition, and to discover errors and omissions.
