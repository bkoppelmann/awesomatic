This directory contains a source distribution of the Eli system.  In order
to make and install Eli, you MUST have a working implementation of Odin,
version 1.16 or later.  If Odin is not running on your machine, you must
install it before attempting to build Eli.

If Odin is running on your system, carry out the following sequence of
steps to build the Eli system:

1) Run the "configure" script
2) Type "make"

Steps (1) and (2) MUST be carried out either on the machine you intend
to run on or on one of the same architecture, running the same version
of the operating system, and with all additional software (e.g. Odin,
Tcl/Tk and all specified libraries) at the same locations in the file
system.

After building the system, you can consult the on-line documentation by
giving the command "pkg/info/info.sh" in the directory containing this
README.  The manual that will be most helpful to you in the early stages
is the "Guide for New Eli Users", which explains how Eli is used via a
simple example.

Mail concerning bug reports and installation problems should be sent
to:

	eli-project-users@lists.sourceforge.net

For further information about Eli, consult our home page at:

Eli is free software.  See the files COPYING and COPYING.LIB for copying
conditions.
