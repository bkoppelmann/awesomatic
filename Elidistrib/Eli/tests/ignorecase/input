{TEST 6.1.1-1, CLASS=CONFORMANCE}

{ The Pascal Standard states that matching upper and lower
  case letters are equivalent in identifiers and word-symbols
  (i.e. reserved words) if they are permitted.  This test does
  not apply to processors with only one letter-case, but otherwise
  the processor passes only if PASS is printed, and fails if the
  program is unacceptable. }
{V3.0: Test reclassified from 6.1.3-2 to current position due
  to change in DP7185 wording.  Comment redrafted to be more
  understandable. }
