# Test suite for validating Eli installation

# These tests have been selected to exercise all of the major components
# of the system, and to make "partial" requests (e.g. scanner only).  They
# are intended to catch systematic errors in installation.  Each compares
# the output produced with the output expected and succeeds if they are
# identical.  If all tests succeed, Eli has been installed successfully.
