<li>trying to access attributes a, b, or c of different type

<p>
==> <tt>ERROR: type conflict in INCLUDING</tt>

<p>
In conjunction with symbol computations

<pre>
     INCLUDING (C.a)     /* C is a CLASS symbol */
</pre>

stands for

<pre>
     INCLUDING (X1.a, X2.a, X3.a, ...)     
</pre>

for all <tt>Xi</tt> that <tt>C</tt> is inherited to.


<p>
