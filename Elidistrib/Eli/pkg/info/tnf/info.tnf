Info is a program for reading documentation, which you are using now.

To learn how to use Info, type the command "h".  It will bring you
to a programmed instruction sequence.

The notation "C-x" (derived from that used in the GNU Emacs editor) is
used to represent the ASCII Control-x character for any letter "x".
"C-?" is used to represent the DELETE or RUBOUT character.

@section Small Screen
@findex screen

Since your terminal has an unusually small number of lines on its
screen, it is necessary to give you special advice at the beginning.

To move forward through the text and see another screen full, press the
Space bar.  To move back up, press the key labeled Rubout or Delete or
DEL.

Here are 40 lines of junk, so you can try Spaces and Rubouts and
see what they do.  At the end are instructions of what you should do
next.

If you have managed to get here, go back to the beginning with
Rubout, and come back here again, then you understand Space and
Rubout.  So now type an "n"--just one character; don't type the
quotes and don't type a Return afterward-- to get to the normal start
of the course.

@node Help, Help-P, Help-Small-Screen, Top
@section Help
@findex n
@findex node
@findex next
@findex previous
@findex up

You are talking to the program Info, for reading documentation.

  Right now you are looking at one "Node" of Information.
A node contains text describing a specific topic at a specific
level of detail.  This node's topic is "how to use Info".

  The top line of a node is its "header".  This node's header (look at
it now) says that it is the node named "Help" in the file "info".
It says that the Next node after this one is the node called "Help-P".
An advanced Info command lets you go to any node whose name you know.

  Besides a "Next", a node can have a "Previous" or an "Up".
This node has a "Previous" but no "Up", as you can see.

  Now it's time to move on to the Next node, named "Help-P".

>> Type "n" to move there.  Type just one character;
   don't type the quotes and don't type a Return afterward.

">>" in the margin means it is really time to try a command.

@node Help-P, Help-C-l, Help, Top
@section P
@findex p

This node is called "Help-P".  The "Previous" node, as you see, is
"Help", which is the one you just came from using the "n" command.
Another "n" command now would take you to the Next node, "Help-C-l".

>> But don't do that yet.  First, try the "p" command, which takes
you to the Previous node.  When you get there, you can do an "n"
again to return here.

  This all probably seems insultingly simple so far, but DON'T be
led into skimming.  Things will get more complicated soon.  Also,
don't try a new command until you are told it's time to.  Otherwise,
you may make Info skip past an important warning that was coming up.

>> Now do an "n" to get to the node "Help-C-l" and learn more.

@node Help-C-l, Help-M, Help-P, Top
@section C-l
@findex space
@findex rubout
@findex b
@findex C-l
@findex ?

Space, Rubout, B and C-l commands.

  This node's header tells you that you are now at node "Help-C-l", and
that "P" would get you back to "Help-P".  The line starting "Space,"
is a "Title", saying what the node is about (most nodes have titles).

  This is a big node and it doesn't all fit on your display screen.  The
Space, Rubout (possibly called Delete on your terminal) and B commands
exist to allow you to "move around" in a node that doesn't all fit on
the screen at once.  Space moves forward, to show what was below the
bottom of the screen.  Rubout moves backward, to show what was above the
top of the screen (there isn't anything above the top until you have
typed some spaces).

>> Now try typing a Space (afterward, type a Rubout to return here).

  When you type the space, the two lines that were at the bottom of the 
screen appear at the top, followed by more lines.  Rubout takes the
two lines from the top and moves them to the bottom, USUALLY, but if
there are not a full screen's worth of lines above them they may not
make it all the way to the bottom.

  If you type a Space when there is no more to see, it will ring the
bell and otherwise do nothing.  The same goes for a Rubout when
the header of the node is visible.

  If your screen is ever garbaged, you can tell Info to print it out
again by typing C-l (Control-l, that is--hold down "Control" and
type an "L" or "l").

>> Type C-l now.

  To move back to the beginning of the node you are on, you can type
a lot of Rubouts.  You can also type simply "b" for beginning.

>> Try that now.  (I have put in enough verbiage to try and make sure
   you are not on the first screenful now).  Then come back, with Spaces.

  You have just learned a considerable number of commands.  If you
want to use one but have trouble remembering which, you should type
a "?" which will print out a brief list of commands.  When you are
finished looking at the list, make it go away by typing a Space.

>> Type a "?" now.  After it finishes, type a Space.

  From now on, you will encounter large nodes without warning, and
will be expected to know how to use Space and Rubout to move
around in them without being told.  Since not all terminals have
the same size screen, it would be impossible to warn you anyway.

>> Now type "n" to see the description of the "m" command.

@node Help-M, Help-Adv, Help-C-l, Top
@section Menus and the M command
@findex m
@findex menu

  With only the "n" and "p" commands for moving between nodes, nodes
are restricted to a linear sequence.  Menus allow a branching
structure.  A menu is a list of other nodes you can move to.  These
nodes may be any nodes in the documentation but are usually subnodes
of the current node.  A menu actually just part of the text of the node
formatted specially so that Info can interpret it.  The beginning of a
menu is always identified by a line which starts with "* Menu:".  A
node contains a menu if and only if it has a line in it which starts
that way.  The only menu you can use at any moment is the one in the
node you are in.  To use a menu in any other node, you must move to
that node first. 

  After the start of the menu, each line that starts with a "*"
identifies one subtopic.  The line will usually contain a brief name
for the subtopic (followed by a ":"), the name of the node that talks
about that subtopic, and optionally some further description of the
subtopic.  Lines in the menu that don't start with a "*" have no
special meaning - they are only for the human reader's benefit and do
not define additional subtopics.  Here is an example:

@example
* Foo:	FOO's Node	This tells about FOO
@end example

The subtopic name is Foo, and the node describing it is "FOO's Node".
The rest of the line is just for the reader's Information.
[[ But this line is not a real menu item, simply because there is
no line above it which starts with "* Menu:".]]

  When you use a menu to go to another node (in a way that will be
described soon), what you specify is the subtopic name, the first
thing in the menu line.  Info uses it to find the menu line, extracts
the node name from it, and goes to that node.  The reason that there
is both a subtopic name and a node name is that the node name must be
meaningful to the computer and may therefore have to be ugly looking.
The subtopic name can be chosen just to be convenient for the user to
specify.  Often the node name is convenient for the user to specify
and so both it and the subtopic name are the same.  There is an
abbreviation for this:

@example
* Foo::   This tells about FOO
@end example

Here the node name has been left out (represented by the two colons).
By default the node name will be the same as the subtopic name.  Thus
in this case the subtopic name and node name are the same; they are
both "Foo". 

>>  Now use Spaces to find the menu in this node, then come back to
the front with a "b".  As you see, a menu is actually visible
in its node.  If you can't find a menu in a node by looking at it,
then the node doesn't have a menu and the "m" command is not available.

  The command to go to one of the subnodes is "m" - but DON'T DO IT
YET!  Before you use "m", you must understand the difference between
commands and arguments.  So far, you have learned several commands
that do not need arguments.  When you type one, Info processes it and
is instantly ready for another command.  The "m" command is different:
it is incomplete without the NAME OF THE SUBTOPIC.  Once you have
typed "m", Info tries to read the subtopic name.

  Now look for the line containing many dashes near the bottom of the
screen.  There is one more line beneath that one, but usually it is
blank.  If it is empty, Info is ready for a command, such as "n" or "b"
or Space or "m".  If that line contains text ending in a colon, it
mean Info is trying to read the ARGUMENT to a command.  At such
times, commands won't work, because Info will try to use them as the
argument.  You must either type the argument and finish the command
you started, or type C-g to cancel the command.  When you have
done one of those things, the line will become blank again.

  The command to go to a subnode via a menu is "m".  After you type
the "m", the line at the bottom of the screen says "Menu item: ".
You must then type the name of type subtopic you want, and end it with
a Return.

  You can abbreviate the subtopic name.  If the abbreviation is not
unique, the first matching subtopic is chosen.  Some menus will put
the shortest possible abbreviation for each subtopic name in capital
letters, so you can see how much you need to type.  It does not
matter whether you use upper case or lower case when you type the
subtopic.  You should not put any spaces at the end, or inside of the
item name, except for one space where a space appears in the item in
the menu.

  Here is a menu to give you a chance to practice.

@menu
The menu starts here.

This menu gives you three ways of going to one place, Help-FOO.

* Foo:	Help-FOO	A node you can visit for fun
* Bar:	Help-FOO	Strange!  two ways to get to the same place.
* Help-FOO::		And yet another!
@end menu

>>  Now type just an "m" and see what happens:

  Now you are "inside" an "m" command.  Commands can't be used now;
the next thing you will type must be the name of a subtopic.

  You can change your mind about doing the "m" by typing C-g.

>> Try that now;  notice the bottom line clear.

>> Then type another "m".

>> Now type "BAR", the item name.  Don't type Return yet.

  While you are typing the item name, you can use the Rubout
character to cancel one character at a time if you make a mistake.

>> Type one to cancel the "R".  You could type another "R" to
   replace it.  You don't have to, since "BA" is a valid abbreviation.

>> Now you are ready to go.  Type a Return.

  After visiting Help-FOO, you should return here.

>> Type "n" to see more commands.

@node Help-FOO, , , Help-M    
@section The U command
@findex u

  Congratulations!  This is the node Help-FOO.  Unlike the other
nodes you have seen, this one has an "Up": "Help-M", the node you
just came from via the "m" command.  This is the usual convention--
the nodes you reach from a menu have Ups that lead back to the menu.
Menus move Down in the tree, and Up moves Up.  Previous, on the other
hand, is usually used to "stay on the same level but go backwards".

  You can go back to the node Help-M by typing the command
"u" for "Up".  That will put you at the FRONT of the node - to get
back to where you were reading you will have to type some Spaces.

>> Now type "u" to move back up to Help-M.

@node Help-Adv, Help-Q, Help-M, Top
@section Some advanced Info commands
@findex l
@findex d
@findex f
@findex C-g

  The course is almost over, so please stick with it to the end.

  If you have been moving around to different nodes and wish to
retrace your steps, the "l" command ("l" for "last") will do that, one
node at a time.  If you have been following directions, an "l" command
now will get you back to Help-M.  Another "l" command would undo the "u"
and get you back to Help-FOO.  Another "l" would undo the M and get you
back to Help-M.

>> Try typing three "l"'s, pausing in between to see what each "l" does.
   Then follow directions again and you will end up back here.

  Note the difference between "l" and "p":  "l" moves to where YOU
last were, whereas "p" always moves to the node which the header says
is the "Previous" node (from this node, to Help-M).

  The "d" command gets you instantly to the Directory node.
This node, which is the first one you saw when you entered Info,
has a menu which leads (directly, or indirectly through other menus),
to all the nodes that exist.

>> Try doing a "d", then do an "l" to return here (yes, DO return).

  Sometimes, in Info documentation, you will see a cross reference.
Cross references look like this: @xref{Help-Cross,Cross}.  That is a
real, live cross reference which is named "Cross" and points at the
node named "Help-Cross".

  If you wish to follow a cross reference, you must use the "f"
command.  The "f" must be followed by the cross reference name (in
this case, "Cross").  You can use Rubout to edit the name, and if you
change your mind about following any reference you can use C-g
to cancel the command.

  Completion is available in the "f" command; you can complete among
all the cross reference names in the current node.

>> Type "f", followed by "Cross", and a Return.

  To get a list of all the cross references in the current node, you can
type "?" after an "f".  The "f" continues to await a cross reference name
even after printing the list, so if you don't actually want to follow
a reference you should type a C-g to cancel the "f".

>> Type "f?" to get a list of the footnotes in this node.  Then
   type a C-g and see how the "f" gives up.

>> Now type "n" to see the last node of the course.

@node Help-Cross, , , Top
@section Cross

  This is the node reached by the cross reference named "Cross".

  While this node is specifically intended to be reached by a cross
reference, most cross references lead to nodes that "belong" someplace
else far away in the structure of Info.  So you can't expect the
footnote to have a Next, Previous or Up pointing back to where you
came from.  In general, the "l" (el) command is the only way to get
back there.

>> Type "l" to return to the node where the cross reference was.

@node Help-Q, , Help-Adv, Top    
@section Q
@findex q

  To get out of Info, back to what you were doing before, type "q"
for "Quit".

  This is the end of the course on using Info.  There are some other
commands that are not essential or meant for experienced users;  they
are useful, and you can find them by looking in the directory for
documentation on Info.  Finding them will be a good exercise in using
Info in the usual manner.

>> Type "d" to go to the Info directory node;
   then type "mInfo" and Return, to get to the node about Info
   and see what other help is available.

@section Some Advanced Info Commands
@findex g
@findex s
@findex 1
@findex 2
@findex 3
@findex 4
@findex 5
@findex e


If you know a node's name, you can go there by typing
"g", the name, and Return.  Thus, "gTop<Return>" would go to the node
called Top in this file (its directory node).  "gExpert<Return>"
would come back here.

Unlike "m", "g" does not allow the use of abbreviations.

To go to a node in another file, you can include the filename in the
node name by putting it at the front, in parentheses.  Thus,
"g(dir)Top<Return>" would go to the Info Directory node, which is node Top
in the file dir.

The node name "*" specifies the whole file.  So you can look at all
of the current file by typing "g*<Return>" or all of any other file
with "g(FILENAME)<Return>".

The "s" command allows you to search a whole file for a string.  It
will switch to the next node if and when that is necessary.  You type
"s" followed by the string to search for, terminated by Return.  To
search for the same string again, just "s" followed by Return will do.
The file's nodes will be scanned in the order they are in in the file,
which has no necessary relationship to the order that they may be in
in the tree structure of menus and next's.  But normally the two
orders will not be far different.  In any case, you can always do a
"b" to find out what node you have reached, if the header isn't
visible (this can happen, because "S" puts your cursor at the
occurrence of the string, not at the beginning of the node).

If you grudge the system each character of type-in it requires,
you might like to use the commands "1", "2", "3", "4", and "5".
They are short for the "m" command together with an argument.
"1" goes through the first item in the current node's menu;
"2" goes through the second item, etc.  Note that numbers
larger than 5 are not allowed.  If the item you want is that
far down, you are better off using an abbreviation for its
name than counting.

@node Printing, Options, Expert, Top
@section Printing things from inside Info
@findex C-t
@findex C-p

For information on how Info decides which printer to use for these
commands, @pxref{Options}.

It is possible to use Info to print two types of information.  The first
is just any information that you can display on the screen.  Using the
C-t command, you can print the contents of the current node to a
printer.  Note that the printout that you get will be just a straight
"ASCII" dump of the node with no formatting other than that that you see
on the screen.

For many applications of Info, it is also possible to get high-quality
laser printed copies of manuals which are being viewed in Info.  The C-p
command has the effect of trying to print the current MANUAL (ie. not
just the current node) as a POSTSCRIPT document.  You should check with
your system maintainer whether this sort of printing is supported for
your documents.  Also be careful what you print as the laser printer
versions of many documents can be quite large.

@node Options, Completion, Printing, Top    
@section Info Options.
@findex EDITOR
@findex WINEDITOR
@findex INFORUNDISPLAY
@findex PRINTER
@findex printing

It is possible for you to customize much of Info's behaviour.  In
particular, you can customize which printer is used by the printing
commands (@pxref{Printing}).  The "o" command is used to examine
and/or set Info options using an interactive interface.  These options
are local to your Info session and have no effect on any shell
variables or other variables you may have outside this session.  The
Info options can be initialized by setting the values of shell
environment variables (see example below) but their values do not
propagate back to those shell variables. 

When you execute the "o" command, a display such as the following will
appear at the top of your screen.

@example
The options which can be set are:

EDITOR              /usr/ucb/vi
    Program to use for editing (see also WINEDITOR).
INFORUNDISPLAY      (null)
    Program to use to display output of 'R' command in parallel.
WINEDITOR           (null)
    Program to use for editing in parallel (preferred over EDITOR).
PRINTER             lp
    Printer to send any printouts to.
@end example

This display lists the currently available options, their current
values, and a description of each option.  At the bottom of the screen
you will be asked the question:

@example
Set which option (RET to finish): 
@end example

To this you type the name of the option which you want to change, or a
RETURN if you are finished with the options.  Then you will see the
prompt:

@example
To what:
@end example

@noindent
to which you type the desired value.  (Eg. "shelltool vi" for the option
WINEDITOR.)  The screen will be updated to reflect the new value which
will be in effect from then on.

If you don't want to have to set the options each time you enter Info,
you can use environment variables.  The Info options are initialised by
the values (if any) of the environment variables with the same names.
For example, to make the printer "myprinter" the default printer for
Info, execute the following command in csh(1):

@example
setenv PRINTER myprinter
@end example

If the environment variables EDITOR and PRINTER are not set, then the
Info options EDITOR and PRINTER default to "/usr/ucb/vi" and "lp",
respectively, as shown above.

@node Completion, Examples, Options, Top    
@section Completing Input
@findex completion
@findex saving typing
@findex typing less

To decrease the amount that you have to type Info supports completion.
This means that in certain contexts where Info has a good idea what you
might type, it can help you.  One such context is when you are using the
"m" command to select a node from a menu.  Info provides facilities so
that you only have to specify the unique part of the thing you are
typing so that it can be distinguished from the other menu items.

The following characters cause special behaviour when completing:

@table @asis
@item SPACE, C-t, TAB
Add to what has been typed so far as much as can be inferred.  If this
is not unique, ring the bell.
@item ?
Print at the top of the screen a list of the completions of what has
been typed so far, but don't add anything.
@item RETURN, NEWLINE
Attempt to complete what has been typed so far into a unique value.  If
this is possible accept that value as the input value, otherwise
complete as much as possible and ring the bell.
@end table

As a simple example, consider a menu containing the items "One", "Two"
and "Only".  When executing the "m" command to select something from
this menu, you could type "T" then RETURN to select "Two", and "O", TAB,
"e", RETURN to select "One".  Note that because "One" and "Only" share a
common prefix you must type the "e" to enable Info to distinguish the two.
In this case completion doesn't save you anything.  In practice, node names
for example, may be quite long and completion is very useful.

Other things that can be accessed using completion are cross references
("f" command), options ("o" command) and file names ("e" command,
@pxref{Examples}).

@node Examples, Complaining, Completion, Top
@section Interacting with examples using Info
@findex e
@findex r
@findex v
@findex example

Info provides a powerful facility for interacting with examples.  It
enables authors to build interactive examples into the documentation
tree and thus make them part of their system's documentation.  Two
facilities are provided for users: running and editing.  These are
flagged by the words "Edit" and/or "Run" in the header of a node.  Eg.

@example
File: doc1,  Node: top,  Next: another,  Eg: EditRun
@end example

When "Run" is present, the "r" command is enabled.  This command
invokes a set of author-specified commands to run the example associated
with the current node.  Once these commands are finished, possibly after
significant interaction with the user, a transcript of the results is
displayed.

If the Info option INFORUNDISPLAY is set, it will be assumed to be the
name of a program to use to display the transcript of an Info run.  It
should take one filename argument.  For example, users of SunView may
use the value "textedit" to get the output of the run displayed in
another window.

If INFORUNDISPLAY is not set, the transcript is displayed by info as a
node, so that it may be viewed using the normal Info commands.  In this
case the "v" command can be used to return to the run output at a later
stage in the Info session.

Usually associated with each example provided using Info are one or more
files.  Typically these files will reside in a documentation directory
and are maintained as part of the system they illustrate.  Info provides
a facility for allowing you to modify these files using the "e" command.
To do this, Info arranges for each file that you edit to be copied into
your directory (ie. the one in which you ran Info).  Thus you are
editing your own copy of the file, not the system copy.  (Note that the
"r" command will also copy the files into your directory in order to be
able to run the example commands.)

The "e" command will prompt you for the name of the file to edit.  Since
completion is available, you can use the "?" character to determine
which files are available for editing along with a small description of
each file.  Once you have selected the file to edit, an editor is
invoked to do the editing.  The options EDITOR and WINEDITOR are assumed
to be a program which takes one argument and edits the file.  If
WINEDITOR is set it will be executed in the background, and is normally
used when you are in a windowing environment like SunView (eg. with a
value of "shelltool vi"). If WINEDITOR is not set, EDITOR will be used.
Note that EDITOR will default to "/usr/ucb/vi" (@pxref{Options}).

If you use WINEDITOR you will be able to edit and use Info at the same
time (assuming you have a window system).  You can exit WINEDITOR at any
time you like.  If you use EDITOR you will have to finish editing before
you can resume your Info session.

Using the "r" and "e" commands, it is possible for you to try out
supplied examples, modify them, try out the modified examples, and
so on.  In addition, you obtain your own copies of the files comprising
the example for possible use outside of Info.

@node Complaining, Standalone, Examples, Top    
@section Complaining about things
@findex c
@findex complaining
@findex mail
@findex maintainer

Working under the principle that the best time to make a complaint is
when the complaint is fresh in your mind, Info provdes the "c" command.
This enables you to easily send mail to the maintainer of the Info
system (and/or the system that is documented by the Info system).

The "c" command simply invokes your mail sender and lets you type your

Note that most mail senders will let you abort sending a message using
your interrupt character (usually either C-c or Delete).  If you decide
not to complain after all, use that method to abort and return to your

@section Standalone use of Info

Info may be used inside GNU Emacs, but there is also a standalone
version (called infoReader in the Eli system).  This section briefly
lists the options which may be used when running Info in this standalone
manner.

@unnumberedsubsec Synopsis
@example
info [ -d info-directory-path ] [ -f info-file ]
  [ -o dump-file] [ -n node-name ] [ menu-name ... ]
@end example

@unnumberedsubsec Description
When Info is invoked, the optional @emph{menu-name} arguments are the
series of menu options that you wish to follow from the main menu.  For
example, to get info about using buffers in Emacs, you might type `info
emacs buffers' (assuming that the Emacs information is available).

The options are as follows:
@table @code
@item -d
A quick way for you to temporarily change the path searched by Info when
it starts up.  You can also set the environment variable
@code{INFO_DIRECTORY_PATHS} to a list of colon-separated directory
names.
@item -f
Specifies which Info file to load.  Normally, Info looks for the file
@file{dir} in the info search path, and goes to node @code{Top} in that
file.  The @file{dir} file contains a menu whose items all point to info
files.  If the info file you wish to view is not in that menu, you can
say @code{info -f info-filename}, and that file specifically will be
used.
@item -n
Sets the initial node to look for.  This allows you to read an info file that
doesn't have a @code{Top} node.
@item -o
Dumps the contents of the node that you have specified, so that you can
do with it what you please.  Note that you can print the node that you
are currently looking at with @code{C-t} from within Info, so it isn't clear
what you want to do with the output from @code{-o}.

@section Internals

Info files are ASCII files with a particular structure.  Here we discuss
that structure while describing the make-up of the major components of
an Info file.

Note that much of the discussion below assumes a context where GNU Emacs
is being used.  (In particular to manipulate the Info file and for
validation.)

@subsection Add

To add a new topic to the list in the directory, you must
 1) create a node, in some file, to document that topic.
 2) put that topic in the menu in the directory.  *Note Menu: Menus.

  The new node can live in an existing documentation file, or in a new
one.  It must have a C-_ character before it (invisible to the user;
this node has one but you can't see it), and it ends with either a C-_,
a C-l, or the end of file.  Note:  If you put in a C-l to end a new
node, be sure that there is a C-_ after it to start the next one, since
C-l can't START a node.  Also, a nicer way to make a node boundary be a
page boundary as well is to put a C-l RIGHT AFTER the C-_.

  The C-_ starting a node must be followed by a newline or a C-l newline,
after which comes the node's header line.  The header line must give
the node's name (by which Info will find it), and state the names of
the Next, Previous, and Up nodes (if there are any).  As you can see,
this node's Up node is the node Top, which points at all the
documentation for Info.  The Next node is "Menus".

  The keywords "Node", "Previous", "Up" and "Next",  may appear in
any order, anywhere in the header line, but the recommended order is
the one in this sentence.  Each keyword must be followed by a colon,
spaces and tabs, and then the appropriate name.  The name may be
terminated with a tab, a comma, or a newline.  A space does not end
it; node names may contain spaces.  The case of letters in the names
is insignificant.

  A node name has two forms.  A node in the current file is named by
what appears after the "Node: " in that node's first line.  For
example, this node's name is "Add".  A node in another file is named
by "(FILENAME)NODE-WITHIN-FILE", as in "(info)Add" for this node.  If
the file name is relative, it is taken starting from the standard
Info file directory of your site.  The name "(FILENAME)Top" can be
abbreviated to just "(FILENAME)".  By convention, the name "Top" is
used for the "highest" node in any single file - the node whose "Up"
points out of the file.  The Directory node is "(dir)".  The Top node
of a document file listed in the Directory should have an "Up: (dir)"
in it.

  The node name "*" is special: it refers to the entire file.  Thus,
g* will show you the whole current file.  The use of the node * is to
make it possible to make old-fashioned, unstructured files into nodes
of the tree.

  The "Node:" name, in which a node states its own name, must not
contain a filename, since Info when searching for a node does not
expect one to be there.  The Next, Previous and Up names may contain
them.  In this node, since the Up node is in the same file, it was not
necessary to use one. 

  Note that the nodes in this file have a File name in the header
line.  The File names are ignored by Info, but they serve as
comments to help identify the node for the user.

@node Menus, Cross-refs, Add, Internals
@subsection Menus

  Any node in the Info hierarchy may have a MENU--a list of subnodes. 
The "m" command searches the current node's menu for the topic which it
reads from the terminal.

  A menu begins with a line starting with "* Menu:".  The rest of the
line is a comment.  After the starting line, every line that begins
with a "* " lists a single topic.  The name of the topic--the arg
that the user must give to the "m" command to select this topic--
comes right after the star and space, and is followed by 
a colon, spaces and tabs, and the name of the node which discusses
that topic.  The node name, like node names following Next,
Previous and Up, may be terminated with a tab, comma, or newline;
it may also be terminated with a period.

  If the node name and topic name are the same, than rather than
giving the name twice, the abbreviation "* NAME::" may be used
(and should be used, whenever possible, as it reduces the visual
clutter in the menu).

  It is considerate to choose the topic names so that they differ
from each other very near the beginning--this allows the user to type
short abbreviations.  In a long menu, it is a good idea to capitalize
the beginning of each item name which is the minimum acceptable
abbreviation for it (a long menu is more than 5 or so entries).

  The node's listed in a node's menu are called its "subnodes", and
it is their "superior".  They should each have an "Up:" pointing at
the superior.  It is often useful to arrange all or most of the
subnodes in a sequence of Next's/Previous's so that someone who
wants to see them all need not keep revisiting the Menu.

  The Info Directory is simply the menu of the node "(dir)Top"--that
is, node Top in file .../info/dir.  You can put new entries in that
menu just like any other menu.  The Info Directory is NOT the same as
the file directory called "info".  It happens that many of Info's
files live on that file directory, but they don't have to; and files
on that directory are not automatically listed in the Info Directory
node.

  Also, although the Info node graph is claimed to be a "hierarchy",
in fact it can be ANY directed graph.  Shared structures and pointer
cycles are perfectly possible, and can be used if they are
appropriate to the meaning to be expressed.  There is no need for all
the nodes in a file to form a connected structure.  In fact, this
file has two connected components.  You are in one of them, which is
under the node Top;  the other contains the node Help which the "h"
command goes to.  In fact, since there is no garbage collector,
nothing terrible happens if a substructure is not pointed to, but
such a substructure will be rather useless since nobody will ever
find out that it exists.

@node Cross-refs, Tags, Menus, Internals
@subsection Cross References

  A cross reference can be placed anywhere in the text, unlike a menu
item which must go at the front of a line.  A cross reference looks
like a menu item except that it has "*note" instead of "*".  It CANNOT
be terminated by a ")", because ")"'s are so often part of node names.
If you wish to enclose a cross reference in parentheses, terminate it
with a period first.  Here are two examples of cross references pointers:

     *Note details: Menus.  (See *note 3: Internals.)

@node Tags, Checking, Cross-refs, Internals
@subsection Tag Tables

  You can speed up the access to nodes of a large Info file by giving
it a tag table.  Unlike the tag table for a program, the tag table for
an Info file lives inside the file itself and will automatically be
used whenever Info reads in the file.

  To make a tag table, go to a node in the file using Info and type
M-x Info-tagify.  Then you must use C-x C-s to save the file.

  Once the Info file has a tag table, you must make certain it is up
to date.  If, as a result of deletion of text, any node moves back
more than a thousand characters in the file from the position
recorded in the tag table, Info will no longer be able to find that
node.  To update the tag table, use the Info-tagify command again.

  An Info file tag table appears at the end of the file and looks like
this:

@example
C-_C-l
Tag Table:
File: info, Node: Cross-refsC-?21419
File: info,  Node: TagsC-?22145
C-_
End Tag Table
@end example

Note that it contains one line per node, and this line contains
the beginning of the node's header (ending just after the node name),
a rubout character, and the character position in the file of the
beginning of the node.

@node Checking, , Tags, Internals
@subsection Checking an Info File

  When creating an Info file, it is easy to forget the name of a node
when you are making a pointer to it from another node.  If you put in
the wrong name for a node, this will not be detected until someone
tries to go through the pointer using Info.  Verification of the Info
file is an automatic process which checks all pointers to nodes and
reports any pointers which are invalid.  Every Next, Previous, and Up
is checked, as is every menu item and every cross reference.  In addition,
any Next which doesn't have a Previous pointing back is reported.
Only pointers within the file are checked, because checking pointers
to other files would be terribly slow.  But those are usually few.

  To check an Info file, do M-x Info-validate while looking at any
node of the file with Info.
