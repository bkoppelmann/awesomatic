If you are using Odin from Asgard,
and invoke Odin from a non-Clearcase directory,
then you need to explicitly set your working dir with a "dir =' command
(or use absolute pathnames for requests).

If a derived file has errors indicating you cannot read one of the
inputs (that is a source file), you must either "touch" the source file
or issue a >:redo on the derived file.
This can happen if someone else that did not have read permission
to the source file previously requested that derived file.
This also can happen if you requested the file when you did not
have read permission to the source file, and then did a "chmod"
to give yourself read permission.
