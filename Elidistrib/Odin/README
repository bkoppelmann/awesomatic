This directory contains the Odin software build system.  Users upgrading
from older Odin versions should consult the file "etc/CHANGES".

For most machines and configurations, the following sequence of two
commands will build an executable version (both commands should be given
in the directory containing this README file):

        ./configure 
	./INSTALL install_dir

"install_dir", if it is present, must be an absolute path name to
an existing directory.	If the "install_dir" argument is omitted, it
defaults to "$HOME".

The INSTALL command will copy the Odin command script to the
file "install_dir/bin/odin", copy the Odin man page to the file
"install_dir/man/man1/odin.1", and install the default packages into
the directory "install_dir/lib/Odin".

None of the installed files or directories should be modified, except
for the file "install_dir/lib/Odin/ODINPATH".  This file can contain a
colon separated list of tool package libraries that will be appended to
every Odin user's $ODINPATH environment variable.

The following command deletes derived files produced during INSTALL of the
Odin system; it does not disturb files created by the configure step:

	./CLEAN
