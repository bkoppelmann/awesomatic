An illustration of the use of Eli for simple "data laundry" problems.
Useful as a tutorial example.  The contents of this directory are:

keywords.fw	Complete specification of the processor

input		Test data

HtmlKeywd.fw	Wrapper for the specification in HTML
TexKeywd.fw	Wrapper for the specification in PostScript
abstract.fwi	Abstract for the printed version

Odinfile	Commands that build some useful products

You can request any of the following products by invoking "eli" with the
name of the product as it argument (e.g. "eli keywords.tex"):

keywords.exe	An executable processor that accepts a file containing a
		grammar and creates two files "keywd.delit" and "keywd.h".
		The purpose of these files and their relationship to the
		grammar is described in the paper.  This processor can be
		applied to file "input".

Keywd.html	A paper describing the problem solved by the processor
Keywd.ps	generated from the specification in this directory,
		explaining the strategy taken in constructing the
		specification, and giving the complete specification
		itself.

The following product should be redirected to a directory (e.g. "eli
'keywords.src>src'").  It consists of all files, including a Makefile,
needed to implement the corresponding processor:

%keywords.src	Source of the keyword processor
