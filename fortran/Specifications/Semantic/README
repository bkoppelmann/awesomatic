Odinfile	Commands that build some useful products

You can request any of the following products by invoking "eli" with the
name of the product as its argument (e.g. "eli f77.exe"):

f77.exe		Executable "lint" program for FORTRAN 77

%t		Execution of the "lint" program for FORTRAN 77 applied to
		file "in"

%p		Execution of the "lint" program for FORTRAN 77, augmented
		with code to print symbol information, applied to file
		"in"

Semantics.html	HTML document defining the semantic analysis problem for
		FORTRAN 77

Semantics.ps	PostScript document defining the semantic analysis problem
		for FORTRAN 77

The following product should be redirected to a directory
(e.g. "eli '%s77>src'").  It consists of all files, including a Makefile,
needed to implement the corresponding processor:

%s77		Source of a "lint" program for FORTRAN 77
