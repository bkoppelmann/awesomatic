Fortran scanner/parser specifications for Eli4.0 or higher.  The contents
of this directory are:

F77Phrase.specs	Specifications for the phrase structure of FORTRAN 77
F77Phrase.fw
F77		Directory containing FORTRAN 77 keyword definitions

F90Phrase.specs	Specifications for the phrase structure of FORTRAN 90
F90Phrase.fw
F90		Directory containing FORTRAN 90 keyword definitions

Include.fw	Specification for INCLUDE file processing

Scan.fw		Specification for FORTRAN lexical analysis

Grammar.fw	Specification for FORTRAN syntactic analysis

HtmlScan.fw	Wrapper for the lexical analysis specification in HTML
TexScan.fw	Wrapper for the lexical analysis specification in PostScript
scan.fwi	Abstract for the printed lexical analysis specification

HtmlParse.fw	Wrapper for the syntactic analysis specification in HTML
TexParse.fw	Wrapper for the syntactic analysis specification in PostScript
parse.fwi	Abstract for the printed syntactic analysis specification

Odinfile	Commands that build some useful products

You can request any of the following products by invoking "eli" with the
name of the product as its argument (e.g. "eli f77.exe"):

f77.exe		Executable scanner/parser for FORTRAN 77
f90.exe		Executable scanner/parser for FORTRAN 90

Scan.html	Formatted lexical analysis specification with hyperlinks
Scan.ps		Formatted lexical analysis specification for printing

The following products should be redirected to a directory (e.g. "eli
'%f77.src>src'").  They consist of all files, including a Makefile, needed
to implement the corresponding processor:

%f77.src        Source of a scanner/parser for FORTRAN 77
%f90.src        Source of a scanner/parser for FORTRAN 90
