Specifications for FORTRAN 77 and FORTRAN 90 processors.  The contents of
this directory are:

Phrase		Directory containing specifications for the phrase
		structures of FORTRAN 77 and FORTRAN 90.  See the README
		file in that directory for more detail.

Semantic	Directory containing specifications for the context
		conditions of FORTRAN 77.  See the README file in that
		directory for more detail.

Odinfile	Commands that build some useful products

You can request any of the following products by invoking "eli" with the
name of the product as its argument (e.g. "eli f77.exe"):

f77.exe		Executable "lint" program for FORTRAN 77

f90.exe		Executable scanner/parser for FORTRAN 90

The following products should be redirected to a directory (e.g. "eli
'%f77.src>src'").  They consist of all files, including a Makefile, needed
to implement the corresponding processor:

%f77.src	Source of a "lint" program for FORTRAN 77

%f90.src	Source of a scanner/parser for FORTRAN 90
