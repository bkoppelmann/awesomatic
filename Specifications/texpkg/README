This directory defines the distributed TeX package for Odin.  The actual
package can be generated using Eli:  In the directory containing this
README, run the following command:

	% eli %package

The subdirectory "tex" is the created package.  Replace the directory
ODIN/pkg/tex with that subdirectory.

After generating and installing the package, reset the cache to include it
by giving the command:

	% eli -R

Once this package has been installed, you can obtain a PostScript copy of
the report describing how it works by giving the command:

	% eli report.ps

The same report can be rendered in PDF by giving the command:

	% eli report.pdf

The files in this directory are:
