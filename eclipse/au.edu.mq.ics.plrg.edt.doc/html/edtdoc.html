<h1>Eli Development User Guide</h1>

<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Eli Development Tools (EDT) is a collection of plugins for the Eclipse Integrated
Development Environment that support development of specifications for the Eli language
processor generation system.</p>

<p>Throughout this documentation it is assumed that the user is familiar with the basics
of using Eclipse. In particular, it is important to be fluent in using the Resource
Perspective to manage projects in the Navigator view. The EDT augments the standard
Eclipse preferences and project properties. It uses the Console and Problems views to
display output and error feedback, respectively. Editors are annotated with markers to
indicate diagnostic output as in the Eclipse Java Development Tools.</p>

<h2><a name="EliProjects"></a>Eli Projects</h2>

<p>The EDT supports the management of Eli projects within Eclipse. An empty Eli project
can be created using a Project wizard under the usual Eclipse New menu. Browse to the Eli
wizard category and invoke the New Eli Project wizard. The wizard has the usual settings
for project name, location and references to other projects.</p>

<p>Eli projects are decorated in the Eclipse Navigator view with an &quot;E&quot; in the
top-right corner of the project icon.</p>

<p>Eli is based on the Odin build management system. See
<a href="#OdinSupport">Odin support</a> for information on the way in which the EDT
helps with the use of Odin within Eli projects.</p>

<h3><a name="ContextMenus"></a>Context Menus</h3>

<p>In the Eclipse Navigator view Eli projects and files and folders within Eli projects
have an &quot;Eli&quot; context menu containing the following item:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reset the derived object cache used by the selected project. This item includes
  the option of reinstalling the cache packages which is useful if you have changed
  the Eli system that you are using.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="OdinSupport"></a>Odin Support</h2>

<p>The Eli system uses the Odin expert system for build management. The main support
consists of an Eli Derivation launch configuration type that appears in the standard
Eclipse "Run..." dialog. There are also a number of project properties and global
preferences can be used to configure the Odin support in the EDT.</p>

<h3><a name="PerformingDerivations"></a>Performing Derivations</h3>

<p>To perform a derivation, use the standard Eclipse run
support via the "Run..." menu.  This menu is available via a toolbar
action or in the main Run menu.  The launch configuration for Eli derivations
operates in a similar manner to other launch configuration types such as
"Java Application".</p>

<p>From the "Run..." dialog, select "Eli Derivation" from the list at
the left.  Click on "New" at the bottom of the list to create a new launch
configuration.  On the right in the Derivation tab, set the properties of
the derivation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The derivation name to be used when referring to this launch configuration
      elsewhere in Eclipse.</li>
  <li>The source file from which the derivation should be performed.  If you had
      the file selected in the Navigator view or its editor was current, then the
      name of the file will be automatically filled in for you.  A "Browse..."
      button allows you to select any file.</li>
  <li>The derivation to perform.  The available derivations are configured via
      the <a href="#ProjectDerivations">Project Derivations</a> preferences page.</li>
  <li>Option arguments to provide to the derivation.</li>
  <li>What to do with the output of the derivation:
  <p><ul>
    <li>Ignore it (most suitable for things like executables).</li>
    <li>Send it to the console view.</li>
    <li>Send it to an Eclipse editor.</li>
    <li>Send it to a file outside of Eli and Eclipse.</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>By default, the output selection will be based on the default output mode
  of the derivation selected, which can be configured in the
  <a href="#ProjectDerivations">Project Derivations</a> preferences page.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the console output mode is chosen the output produced by Eli while performing
the derivation will be displayed in the Eli Console view. (Note that the Console
View may not be shown by default. Use the &quot;Show View&quot; and then
&quot;Other...&quot; items in the Window menu to enable it.). Use the
<a href="#LogLevel">Log Level preference</a> and the
<a href="#ErrLevelAndWarnLevel">Error and Warning Level preferences</a> to control
how much information Eli prints as it performs a derivation. Each different launch
configuration will get a new console; all consoles are selected from the drop-down
at the top of the Console View so you can switch between them.</p>

<p>In the editor view output mode the behaviour depends on whether the
file to be viewed resides in the Eclipse workspace or not.  If it does, then
the editor is opened on the actual file as would be expected.  If the file
resides outside the workspace then a link to the file is created at the top
level of the Eli project and the editor is opened on the link.</p>

<p>In the file output mode the product produced by the derivation is sent to the
file specified in the launch configuration.  The name of the file is relative
to the Eclipse workspace.  A browse button can be used to help set the file name.</p>

<p>If a derivation produces diagnostic output (error, warning, note etc) the messages
are entered into the Eclipse Problems view.  (This view may not be visible by default
in your Resource perspective.)  If errors are reported then other requested effects 
(show, edit or send to file) are not performed.  Lines referred to by diagnostic
output are marked in open editors. Finally, if you open the Package Explorer View
it will annotate files containing errors or warnings with  a red cross (error) or
a yellow exclamation mark (warning). </p>

<p>The derivations that are available in a new Eli project are initially determined
by a global list maintained by the EDT. You can edit the derivations via the
<a href="#ProjectDerivations">Project Derivations</a> preferences page. When you
exit Eclipse the derivations will be saved in your workspace. The workspace
derivations will be loaded by the EDT when you next work on an Eli project. Thus
all of your Eli projects in a single workspace will share the same set of derivations
that you maintain. </p>

<h3><a name="EliProjectProperties"></a>Eli Project Properties</h3>

<p>The following properties apply to a specific Eli project. </p>

<h4><a name="EliExecutable"></a>Eli Executable</h4>

<p>On Unix-based systems, this property should be set to the executable to use to
perform Eli derivations. It should be set to the &quot;eli&quot; script of an
installed Eli system.</p>

<p>On Windows systems, life is more complicated. Eli on Windows is supported by the
Cygwin Unix-like software. Unfortunately, Eclipse (a Windows application) cannot call
the &quot;eli&quot; script directly because it is a (Cygwin) shell script. For this 
eason on Windows systems the Eli Executable should be set to the location of the
Cygwin shell executable (usually C:\Cygwin\bin\sh.exe). The
<a href="#EliArguments">Eli Arguments</a> property should also be set (see notes in
the next section). </p>

<p>See also the <a href="#DefaultEliExecutable	">Default Eli Executable</a> global
preference. </p>

<h4><a name="EliArguments"></a>Eli Arguments</h4>

<p>This property can be used to pass extra arguments to the invocation of Eli. On
Unix systems this is usually not needed so the arguments should be empty.</p>

<p>On Windows systems, the arguments should be set to the location of the &quot;eli&quot;
script of an installed Eli system. In conjunction with the appropriate setting for
the <a href="#EliExecutable">Eli Executable</a> (see notes in the previous section)
this will enable Eclipse to correctly invoke Eli. </p>

<p>See also the <a href="#DefaultEliArguments">Default Eli Arguments</a> global preference. </p>

<h4><a name="CacheFolder"></a>Cache Folder</h4>

<p>Eli uses a cache directory to hold the results of derivations and the intermediate
objects produced by those derivations. By default, the cache used for an Eli project
is the .ODIN folder in the project folder. This means that objects will not be shared
with other projects. </p>

<p>The cache folder property can be changed if a different cache folder is desired.
For example, you might set the cache folder for two Eil projects to be the same
directory to enable those projects to share derived objects which can save some
disk space.</p>

<p>For convenience, the <a href="#ContextMenus">Eli context menu</a> for Eli projects
provides a &quot;Reset Cache&quot; item which invokes Eli to reset the project cache. </p>

<p>See also the <a href="#DefaultCacheFolder">Default Cache Folder</a> global preference.</p>

<h4><a name="CacheView"></a>Cache View</h4>

<p>Normally, Eli's cache contains a directory specific to the machine on which you
are running.  If you wish to share caches between machines you can set the cache view
property to a string which will be used instead of the machine name.</p>

<p>Note: Normally Eli run under Eclipse control will inherit your environment
settings from the parent process so the ODINVIEW environment variable will be
available to Eli if you have set it in your environment.  However, at present
the EDT needs to know the value of this variable and there is no portable way
to obtain the value.  So, at present, you should make sure that the Cache View
property is set to the same value as your ODINVIEW environment variable.  We
plan to simplify this situation in future versions.</p>

<p>See also the <a href="#DefaultCacheView">Default Cache View</a> global preference.</p>

<h3><a name="EliGlobalPreferences"></a>Eli Global Preferences</h3>

<p>The following preferences apply to all Eli projects.</p>

<h4><a name="DefaultEliExecutable"></a>Default Eli Executable</h4>

<p>This preference can be used to specify a default Eli executable which is particularly
useful in the normal case where a single Eli installation is used for all projects. The
setting of this preference will be used to initialise the
<a href="#EliExecutable">Eli Executable</a> property of all new projects.</p>

<h4><a name="DefaultEliArguments"></a>Default Eli Arguments</h4>

<p>This preference can be used to specify a default Eli arguments which is particularly
useful in the normal case where a single Eli installation is used for all projects. The
setting of this preference will be used to initialise the
<a href="#EliArguments">Eli Arguments</a> property of all new projects.</p>

<h4><a name="DefaultCacheFolder"></a>Default Cache Folder</h4>

<p>By default when an Eli project is created it uses a cache within the project directory
(see the <a href="#CacheFolder">Cache Folder</a> project property). If you want all of
your Eli projects to share the same cache you can enable the Default Cache Folder and
set it to a directory to use for the common cache. Any new Eli projects created will
use the common cache folder.</p>

<h4><a name="DefaultCacheView"></a>Default Cache View</h4>

<p>This preference is used as the cache view value for new projects (see the
<a href="#CacheView">Cache View</a> project property).</p>

<p>Note: Normally Eli run under Eclipse control will inherit your
environment settings from the parent process so the ODINVIEW
environment variable will be available to Eli if you have set it in
your environment.  However, at present the EDT needs to know the value
of this variable and there is no portable way to obtain the value.
So, at present, you should make sure that the Default Cache View
preference is set to the same value as your ODINVIEW environment
variable.  We plan to simplify this situation in future versions.</p>

<h4><a name="ClearConsole"></a>Clear Console</h4>

<p>Output produced by Eli derivations can be sent to the Eclipse console view.
When set (the default), this preference causes the console to be cleared before
each derivation.</p>

<h4><a name="LogLevel"></a>Log Level</h4>

<p>The log level controls the verbosity of Eli while it is performing derivations.
It defaults to causing each object generated by a tool script to be reported as it
is derived, plus objects with errors, Odin commands and build commands.</p>

<h4><a name="ErrLevelAndWarnLevel"></a>ErrLevel and WarnLevel</h4>

<p>The error and warning levels control how much information Eli provides about
errors and warnings associated with derivations, respectively. The options are
to see no report at all, to see final status information, to see messages
incrementally as they are produced by tool steps, or to see a summary of all
relevant messages. The default is to produce no report. </p>

<h4><a name="ProjectDerivations"></a>Project Derivations</h4>

<p>The derivations available within all Eli projects can be edited via a
preference page. The page presents two pulldown menus at the top for selecting
a category, and within that category, a derivation. When a derivation is
selected, the data defining the derivation will be shown below the pulldown menus.</p>

<p>The derivation data fields apart from category and name are: the Eli product
that is derived by this derivation (e.g., &quot;:exe&quot;), a documentation
string describing the derivation, and the enabled flag. If the enabled flag
is set then the derivation will be available for use (see
<a href="#PerformingDerivations">Performing Derivations</a>).</p>

<p>The product field of a derivation ordinarily contains a full Odin derivation
command with placeholders for parts that depend on the specific derivation being
performed.  The following placeholders are used:</p>

<ul>
<li>%a: the optional arguments from the launch configuration</li>
<li>%d: the full pathname of the project directory in which the derivation is
being performed</li>
<li>%s: the full pathname of the source specification from which the derivation
is being performed</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the product "%s :exe" will turn into ".../foo.fw :exe" if it is
applied to the specification file "foo.fw" where "..." is the full pathname of
"foo.fw".  Similarly, "%d +cmd=(%s:exe) %a :run" specifies a derivation that
is applied to the current project directory, supplies a +cmd parameter that is
the executable derived from the source specification, appends any supplied
arguments and derives the :run product.</p>

<p>To change the definition of a derivation, first select it using the pulldown
menus. Then edit the derivation data as appropriate and hit the Apply button. Any
changes to the data fields will be lost if you do not hit Apply before you select
another derivation or close the property page. </p>

<p>To create a new derivation, hit the New button. This will create a new derivation
in the current category with a default definition. You must edit the data fields
and hit Apply to correctly define the derivation. Note that the category, name 
nd product fields must not be blank. </p>

<p>To delete a derivation, first select it. Then hit the Delete button. </p>

<h2><a name="ReleaseNotes"></a>Release Notes</h2>

The following summarises the major changes in each version of the Eli Development
Tools.

<h3>1.06 (FIXME) </h3><ul>
  <li>Changed derivations to use placeholders so that more flexible derivations are
  possible.</li>
  <li>Added optional arguments to the launch configuration type.</li>
  <li>Added a "Run" derivation that uses :run to execute a processor on arguments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.05 (November 10, 2006) </h3><ul>
  <li>Numerous small bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in processing of messages that don't include a severity in the usual
  place.</li>
  <li>Support for ODINVIEW environment variable.</li>
  <li>Eli context menu now available on folders and projects.</li>
  <li>Changed derivation invocation to use the launch configuration mechanism (hence
  Run action) rather than our home-grown Derive action.  This also means that history
  is handled by the Run mechanism so the Rederive action is gone too.</li>

  Windows-specific notes for the <a href="#EliExecutable">Eli Executable</a> and
  <a href="#EliArguments">Eli Arguments</a> properties and the corresponding global
  preferences.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.03 (July 23, 2004)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Toolbar actions now only available in Eli projects. </li>
  <li>Suggest that users use the Project Navigator view to manage their Eli projects
  since this shows error and warning markers (unlike the Navigator view). </li>
  <li>Remove most mentions of Odin in the documentation and plugins. </li>
  <li>Added project derivations preference page to allow derivations to be created
  and edited.</li>
  <li>Added enable flag to derivations so they can be temporarily hidden without
