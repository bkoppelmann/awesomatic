This plugin contains documentation for the Eli language
processor generation system.

To update the documentation in this plugin to the latest version:

1. Obtain the latest version of the elionline documentation.  This
will normally come as a TAR gzip archive.  We assume that it is
elionline4.4.tgz in the following.

2. Unpack the documentation in the plugin directory.

% tar xvzf elionline4.4.tgz

4. Rename the "elionline4.4" sub-directory to "html".

% mv elionline4.4 html

5. Run the script rmtables.  This will remove the side-bar in the
documentation that contains the list of documents.  This is no longer
needed since the Eclipse help browser will have an outline of the
documents in its table of contents.

% rmtables

6. Edit the section introductions in the intros/ directory.  These
   introductions serve to describe the main sections in the
   documentation.  They are needed because the regular Eli
   documentation doesn't have them and we get blank pages when the
   documentation sections are clicked on in the Eclipse help.

7. When you are happy with the section introductions, copy all of
   them to the html directory.

% cp intros/*.html html

8. Remove the old documentation and tables of contents (but not main_toc.xml).

% rm doc.zip gen_toc.xml lib_toc.xml ref_toc.xml tasks_toc.xml tools_toc.xml tute_toc.xml

9. Run the script builddocs which will create the new tables of
contents files.

% buildtocs

10. Zip the html directory into doc.zip.

zip -r doc.zip html
